travel audience Go challenge
============================

Task
----

Write an HTTP service that exposes an endpoint "/numbers". This endpoint receives a list of URLs 
though GET query parameters. The parameter in use is called "u". It can appear 
more than once.

	http://yourserver:8080/numbers?u=http://example.com/primes&u=http://foobar.com/fibo

When the /numbers is called, your service shall retrieve each of these URLs if 
they turn out to be syntactically valid URLs. Each URL will return a JSON data 
structure that looks like this:

	{ "numbers": [ 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13 ] }

The JSON data structure will contain an object with a key named "numbers", and 
a value that is a list of integers. After retrieving each of these URLs, the 
service shall merge the integers coming from all URLs, sort them in ascending 
order, and make sure that each integer only appears once in the result. The 
endpoint shall then return a JSON data structure like in the example above with 
the result as the list of integers.

The endpoint needs to return the result as quickly as possible, but always 
within 500 milliseconds. It needs to be able to deal with error conditions when 
retrieving the URLs. If a URL takes too long to respond, it must be ignored. It 
is valid to return an empty list as result only if all URLs returned errors or 
took too long to respond. The timeout must be respected regardless of 
the size of the data.

The service should widely implement HTTP status codes and use them as documented in the [the specification](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html).
Consider different status codes for different cases.

Example
-------

The service receives an HTTP request:

	>>> GET /numbers?u=http://example.com/primes&u=http://foobar.com/fibo HTTP/1.0

It then retrieves the URLs specified as parameters.

The first URL returns this response:

	>>> GET /primes HTTP/1.0
	>>> Host: example.com
	>>> 
	<<< HTTP/1.0 200 OK
	<<< Content-Type: application/json
	<<< Content-Length: 34
	<<< 
	<<< { "numbers": [ 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13 ] }

The second URL returns this response:

	>>> GET /fibo HTTP/1.0
	>>> Host: foobar.com
	>>> 
	<<< HTTP/1.0 200 OK
	<<< Content-Type: application/json
	<<< Content-Length: 40
	<<< 
	<<< { "numbers": [ 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21 ] }

The service then calculates the result and returns it.

	<<< HTTP/1.0 200 OK
	<<< Content-Type: application/json
	<<< Content-Length: 44
	<<< 
	<<< { "numbers": [ 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 11, 13, 21 ] }


Development
---------------------
As a reference, you will be provided with an tiny golang app that, when 
run, listens on port 8090 and provides the endpoints /primes, /fibo, /odd and 
/rand.

To improve your experience additional remote server will be provided to you.
The same server will be later used by us to evaluate the solution. 
It exposes single endpoint `/numbers` that can be used in a similar way 
like ones provided by the reference. 
This endpoint in its behaviour is trying to mimic real-world application.
Different payload sizes, status codes and response times can be expected.


Completion Conditions
---------------------

Solve the task described above using Go. Only use what's provided in the Go 
standard library. The resulting program must run stand-alone with no other 
dependencies than the Go compiler.

Document your source code, both using comments and in a separate text file that 
describes the intentions and rationale behind your solution. Also write down 
any ambiguities that you see in the task description, and describe you how you 
interpreted them and why. If applicable, write automated tests for your code.

Please return your working solution within 7 days of receiving the challenge.
